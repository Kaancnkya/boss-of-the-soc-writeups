2. **Vendor URL analysis**  
   Looking into the `vendor_url` field showed multiple hits pointing to **`/joomla/` paths** such as:  
   - `/joomla/index.php/component/search/`  
   - `/joomla/administrator/index.php`  
   - `/joomla/index.php`  

   This strongly indicated that Joomla was being used as the CMS.

3. **Cross-validation with stream:http logs**  
   Running the query against `stream:http` confirmed repeated requests to Joomla directories.

   Reviewing the `uri` and `uri_path` fields showed that over **64%** of traffic went to `/joomla/index.php/component/search/`.  
   Other Joomla-related directories were also frequently accessed.
