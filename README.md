# Splunk BOTS (Boss of the SOC) Writeups

This repository contains my hands-on analysis and writeups for Splunk's **Boss of the SOC (BOTS)** challenges.  
Each scenario simulates real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) investigations, and I documented my approach, queries, evidence, and findings.

The logs used in these challenges are provided by **Splunk BOTS datasets** (not included in this repository).  
This repo focuses on my **analysis process, screenshots, and conclusions**, rather than raw log data.

## ️ Tools & Technologies

- **Splunk Enterprise**: log analysis, queries (SPL)
- **Security Onion / SOC mindset**: investigative process
- **Markdown + GitHub**: documentation, evidence tracking

---

## Purpose

- Practice **incident investigation** with realistic datasets  
- Build **SOC analyst skills** (log analysis, detection, threat hunting)  
- Create a **portfolio-ready project** demonstrating practical cybersecurity experience  

---

## Next Steps

- Complete all questions for **Web Defacement** and **Ransomware** scenarios  
- Add screenshots and SPL queries into each `evidence/` and `writeup.md`  
- Expand with future BOTS scenarios (phishing, C2 detection, etc.)  


## Notes

- The original datasets belong to **Splunk BOTS** events and are not redistributed here.  
- This repo is strictly for **educational and portfolio purposes**.
